Created a simple webpage (using HTML-CSS and Javascript) to teach multiplication to my nephew Sajid during COVID-19 pandemic. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user can perform 3 x 2 digit multiplications.
The fonts are very visible through video call.
The webpage scatters if not viewed in full screen. 
Trying to fix this issue using Bootstrap 4 and/or other technologies.
