Created a simple webpage (using HTML-CSS and Javascript) to teach multiplication and division to my nephew Sajid during COVID-19 pandemic. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The user can perform 3 x 2 digit multiplications.
- The user can divide any non-negative 3 digit number by any non-negative 1 digit number.
- The division will perform successfully only if the remainder of the of the division is 0 (zero).
- Added Times Tables 
- The fonts are very visible through video call.
- The webpage scatters if not viewed in full screen. 
- Trying to fix this issue using Bootstrap 4 and/or other technologies.
